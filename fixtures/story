Once upon a time there was a great hero, called Orderus, with some strengths and weaknesses,
as all heroes have.

After battling all kinds of monsters for more than a hundred years, Orderus was now a mighty warrior, feared by many.

But no! As he walked in the forest, he encountered a group of mighty beasts. And so, once again, Orderus must fight to survive.
